As 2025 comes to a close, it's time for my annual review. This post covers what worked, what didn't, and what I'm taking into the new year.

## Goals Achievement Summary

| Goal | Target | Achieved | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| Books Read | 20 | 19 | 95% |
| Exercise Sessions | 100 | 97 | 97% |
| New Skills | 4 | 3 | 75% |
| Side Projects | 2 | 2 | 100% |

Overall, a solid year with room for improvement.

## What Worked

1. **Morning routines** - Starting each day with intention made a huge difference
2. **Weekly reviews** - Regular check-ins kept me on track
3. **Habit stacking** - Linking new habits to existing ones

## What Didn't Work

1. **Overcommitting** - I tried to do too many things at once
2. **Ignoring rest** - Pushed too hard in Q3 and burned out briefly
3. **Perfectionism** - Spent too long on things that didn't matter

## Key Takeaways

The biggest insight from 2025: **Progress over perfection**. It's better to consistently show up at 80% than to sporadically appear at 100%.

## Looking Ahead

I'm excited for 2026. My focus will be on building sustainable systems rather than chasing arbitrary targets.

Thanks for following along. See you next year!
