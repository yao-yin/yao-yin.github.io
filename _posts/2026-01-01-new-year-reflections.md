Happy New Year! As 2026 begins, I'm taking some time to reflect on the past year and set intentions for the year ahead.

## Looking Back at 2025

2025 was a year of growth. Some highlights:

- Read 19 books (goal was 20 - close enough!)
- Completed 97 exercise sessions
- Learned 3 new skills
- Launched 2 side projects

Not every goal was met, but progress was made in all areas.

## What I Learned

The most important lesson from 2025 was the power of consistency over intensity. Small daily actions compound into significant results over time.

## 2026 Goals

This year, I'm focusing on:

### First Half (H1)
- Read 12 books
- Write 26 blog posts
- 75 exercise sessions
- Learn 6 new skills

### Second Half (H2)
- Read 12 more books
- Write 26 more blog posts
- Another 75 exercise sessions
- Learn 6 more skills

## Why I Track Publicly

I've found that public accountability helps me stay on track. By sharing my goals and progress here, I'm more likely to follow through.

You can follow my progress on the [Goals Dashboard](/dashboard).

Here's to a productive 2026!
