Hello and welcome to my newly redesigned personal site!

I've built this site to serve three main purposes:

1. **Blog** - A space for me to share thoughts, ideas, and learnings
2. **Goals Dashboard** - A public tracker for my 2026 goals
3. **About** - A bit about who I am

## Why a Goals Dashboard?

I believe in public accountability. By tracking my goals publicly, I'm more motivated to make consistent progress. You can check out my [2026 Goals Dashboard](/dashboard) to see how I'm doing.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about various topics that interest me. Stay tuned for more posts!

Thanks for visiting.
