As we kick off 2026, I wanted to share my reading goals for the year. I'm aiming to read 24 books this year, split evenly between the two halves.

## What I Want to Read

I'm planning to focus on a mix of:

- **Technical books** - Staying sharp with new technologies
- **Non-fiction** - Learning about business, psychology, and history
- **Fiction** - Because everyone needs a good story

## My Reading Strategy

Last year I learned that setting a weekly reading habit works better than setting a yearly goal. My plan is to:

1. Read for at least 30 minutes each day
2. Always have a book in progress
3. Keep a simple reading log

## Current Reading List

Here are some books on my to-read list:

- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
- "The Pragmatic Programmer" (20th Anniversary Edition)
- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear

I'll be tracking my progress on the [Goals Dashboard](/dashboard). Wish me luck!
